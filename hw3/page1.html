    <h2>History</h2>
   
    <div class="container">
        <div class="text"> <p>The territory of modern-day Georgia was inhabited by Homo erectus since the Paleolithic Era. <br> The proto-Georgian tribes first appear in written history in the 12th century BC. The earliest evidence <br> of wine to date has been found in Georgia, where 8,000-year old wine jars were uncovered. Archaeological <br>finds and references in ancient sources also reveal elements of early political and state formations characterized <br> by advanced metallurgy and goldsmith techniques that date back to the 7th century BC and beyond. In fact, early <br> metallurgy started in Georgia during the 6th millennium BC, associated with the Shulaveri-Shomu culture.</p></div>
